oVirt Engine Setup
==================

Install required packages for oVirt Engine deployment, generates answerfile
and runs engine-setup.
Optionally the role update oVirt engine packages.

Note
----
Please note that when installing this role from Ansible Galaxy you are instructed to run following command:

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy install ovirt.engine-setup
```

This will download the role to the directory with the same name as you specified on the
command line, in this case `ovirt.engine-setup`. But note that it is case sensitive, so if you specify
for example `OVIRT.engine-setup` it will download the same role, but it will add it to the directory named
`OVIRT.engine-setup`, so you later always have to use this role with upper case prefix. So be careful how
you specify the name of the role on command line.

For the RPM installation we install three legacy names `oVirt.engine-setup`, `ovirt.engine-setup` and `ovirt-engine-setup`.
So you can use any of these names. This documentation and examples in this repository are using name `ovirt.engine-setup`.
`oVirt.engine-setup` and `ovirt-engine-setup` role names are deprecated.

Role Variables
--------------

By default engine-setup uses answer file specific for version of oVirt,
based on ``ovirt_engine_setup_version`` parameter. You can specify own answer file
as ``ovirt_engine_setup_answer_file_path``.

* Common options:

| Name                            | Default value         |  Description                                              |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

| ovirt_engine_setup_product_type       | oVirt                 | One of ["oVirt", "RHV"], case insensitive. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_package_list       | []                    | List of extra packages to be installed on engine apart from ovirt-engine package. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_answer_file_path   | UNDEF                 | Path to custom answerfile for `engine-setup`. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_use_remote_answer_file | false             | If `True`, use answerfile's path on the remote machine. This option should be used if the installation occure on the remote machine and the answerfile is located on there also. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_organization       | UNDEF                 | Organization name for certificate. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_firewall_manager   | firewalld             | Specify the type of firewall manager to configure on Engine host, following values are availableL: `firewalld`,`iptables` or empty value to skip firewall configuration. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_update_setup_packages | False              | If `True`, setup packages will be updated before `engine-setup` will be executed. Makes sense if Engine is already installed. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_update_all_packages | True                 | If `True`, all packages will be updated before `engine-setup` will be executed. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_offline            | False                 | If `True`, `engine-setup` will not search for package updates. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_require_rollback   | UNDEF                 | If `True` setup will require to be able to rollback new packages in case of a failure. If not passed the default answer from `engine-setup` will be chosen. Valid for updating/upgrading. |
| ovirt_engine_setup_admin_password     | UNDEF                 | Password for the automatically created administrative user of the oVirt Engine.

| ovirt_engine_setup_wait_running_tasks | False                 | If true, engine-setup will wait till running tasks finish. Valid for `ovirt_engine_setup_version` >= 4.2 |
| ovirt_engine_cinderlib_enable         | False                 | If true, cinderlib enabled.. Valid for `ovirt_engine_setup_version` >= 4.3 |
